build.vim
=========

Build and run your projects (or standalone files) with ease! This
plugin creates :Build and :Run commands which detect the filetype of
what your editing -- or whether you have a Makefile, CMakeLists.txt,
or cabal file -- and performs the necessary steps to compile/run!
Running is done in a new tmux window currently, but in future versions
that will be an option (and possibly will be detected as well).
